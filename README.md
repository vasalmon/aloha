## Mobile-First, Intuitive Layout
This apparel sales website uses a responsive, mobile-first approach through scalable units, percentages, and CSS media queries to modify mobile styles along break-points and optimize use for tablets (600px) and desktops (1240px).

## Navigation
Compact, easy to use navigation menus clearly expose the layout while incorporating smooth scrolling. If we view the page first as a Tablet, we see a clean looking header.

The responsive mobile-first design uses an elegant flexbox solution to quickly and easily compact the width of the header by shifting the order of the flexbox items, pushing the nav to another row and creating a light border.

The view from Desktop is similar to Tablet but images are larger for a richer experience.

## Shop
The shopping area maximizes its use of visual real estate filling as much of the screen with images as possible while retaining a minimal design.

In Tablet, flexbox easily pops the tiles onto two lines making better use of the additional width.

Finally, in Desktop, the tiles continue to scale to make use of the space available.

## Carousel: Flickity
The carousel is a jQuery implementation of Flickity with its options set for the cleanest experience. The autoPlay and wrapAround are enabled while the previous and next arrows are disabled for an understated but continuous experience.

As space is available the carousel expands to show more results (2 per line on tablet).

As more space becomes available, the carousel comes alive showcasing 4 results at a time.

## Email Subscription
One function of the Aloha Apparel website is to allow for e-mail submission. Using Javascript, the default behaviour of the submit button is modified to produce an alert box with some basic form validation.
